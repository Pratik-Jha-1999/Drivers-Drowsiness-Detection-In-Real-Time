# Drivers-Drowsiness-Detection-In-Real-Time
This is an application based project, which can be used to detect driver's drowsiness in real time and alarm him.
This uses technologies like AI and machine learning implemented by openCV and Dlib in python.
Basically, here we are reading the face of the person driving the vehicle and puting facial landmarks on his face.
After that we calculate the gap between the position of the eye's landmarks and tell how sleepy or active he is.
